The accurate prediction of historical PM2.5 is critical and essential in environmental health management and making air pollution control strategies.An innovative deep ensemble model (DEM) based on ensemble Super Learner (SL) was proposed to predict the daily PM2.5 concentration.An R package called [deeper](https://github.com/Alven8816/deeper) was newly built to fit the DEM approach.
